# CycleGAN for Medical Image Denoising

This project provides a simplified implementation of a CycleGAN used for denoising medical images.  
The full version includes advanced pipelines used in an HPC environment with 3D NIfTI images and mixed precision training.

## Features
- ResNet-based Generator and Discriminator
- Paired and Unpaired Training Support
- Evaluation: PSNR, SSIM, and QILV
- AMP (Mixed Precision) Support

## Structure
- `models/`: Generator and Discriminator definitions
- `utils/`: Data loading and metrics
- `examples/`: Sample input/output NIfTI files

> This repo includes a simplified version only. Full training code is omitted for publication/privacy reasons.
