# CycleGAN for Medical Image Denoising

This project demonstrates a simplified CycleGAN pipeline for denoising 2D medical images using paired and unpaired training. 
The original version was used in a high-performance computing environment with 3D NIfTI images.

## Key Features
- Generator and Discriminator based on ResNet blocks
- Training with paired or unpaired datasets
- Evaluation using PSNR, SSIM, and custom metrics (QILV)
- Mixed precision support (AMP)

> This repo includes a simplified version for demonstration purposes.

> Full source code and training scripts used in publication-quality experiments are not publicly released due to dataset licensing and ongoing research. Please contact for collaborations or more information.
